# RESTful_API

This is a simple RESTful API for managing a collection of movies, built using Node.js and Express. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of movies. The API supports the following functionalities:

Get all movies: Retrieve a list of all movies in the collection.
Get movies by genre: Filter movies based on their genre.
Add a new movie: Add a new movie to the collection with required details like title, director, genre, and release year.
Update a movie: Modify an existing movie's details based on its ID.
Delete a movie: Remove a movie from the collection using its ID.

This backend project is a great starting point for building movie management systems or exploring API development with Express.js. The data is stored in-memory, making it easy to test and extend further with features like database integration or advanced search capabilities.
